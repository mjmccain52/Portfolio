******* CHESS DESIGN DOCUMENT ****************

******* MICHAEL MCCAIN ******************

Structures:

	Board configuration:
		I'm using a vector from the STL to hold a grin of board positions,
		a vector of vectors of squares.  That way I will easily be able to
		access all board positions instantly by index.
		
	sets of moves:
		A STL set of the Move object will do nicely, since duplicates are
		pointless, accessing by key sounds like a handy feature, and iterating
		doesn't sound necessary at this point in my program (I'll overload == for
		my Move class)
	move history:
		The STL stack is far and away the easiest decision of all the data structures.
		Oldest moves are at the bottom of the stack, and I have instant access to the
		most recent moves at the top.  Beauty.
