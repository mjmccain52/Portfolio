This is a sample of the code I wrote for the BYU Neuromechanics lab in 2013.

I did so completely independently, as no one else in the research group (including the professor) knew how to program anything other than MATLAB.

For context, all the programs center around the Leap Motion controller (https://www.leapmotion.com/) being used in various ways to detect hand tremors to aid in Dr. Steven Charles's research (https://neuromechanics.byu.edu/)
